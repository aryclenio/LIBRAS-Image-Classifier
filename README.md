# LIBRAS-Image-Classifier

This project demonstrates the use of neural networks and computer vision to create a classifier that interprets the Brazilian Sign Language. At the moment, the project interprets only the first 6 letters of the alphabet.
A Convolutional Neural Network was used in order to train and test a network so that, through the webcam, it is possible to identify the signal made by the user's hand.
